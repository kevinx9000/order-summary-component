## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is the first time that I have tried a mobile-first workflow. My understanding is that it's the industry standard to do so. But admittedly, I found it more difficult than starting with a desktop workflow first. Perhaps with more practice I'll get better and prefer it.
